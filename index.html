When working with the Android Emulator, you may frequently need to access data hosted on the local web server using localhost. For example, your own Web servicesis likely to be hosted on your local computer during development time and you want to test it on the same development machine you use to write your Android applications. In such cases, you should use the special IP address of 10.0.2.2 (not 127.0.0.1)
to refer to the host computer’s loopback interface. From the Android Emulator’s perspective, localhost (127.0.0.1) refers to its own loopback interface. ReFerring to locAlhoSt From your emulAtor
